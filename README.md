# Mobile Price Classification using SVC

This project applies **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to the **Mobile Price Classification dataset** from Kaggle.  
Since the official test set had no labels, the train set  was manually split into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.  
The goal of this project is to accurately classify mobile phones into their respective price ranges using ML techniques.

##  Key Features
- âœ… Used `train_test_split` with a **test ratio of 0.2** to evaluate performance.  
- âœ… Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize the feature data for better SVC convergence.  
- âœ… Implemented **GridSearchCV** and **StratifiedKFold** to tune hyperparameters and ensure robust evaluation.  
- âœ… Trained the final model using the best parameters found via Grid Search.  
- âœ… Predicted on the split test set and evaluated performance metrics.  
- âœ… Displayed **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report Heatmap** using `seaborn` for visual insights.  
- âœ… Achieved **high accuracy and consistency** across validation folds and test data.
